Python parts:
- Make the different states and displayed types in room solver app concentrated somewhere
- Begin using type hints

C++ parts:
- Use asserts instead of exceptions in C++
- Do level walking search in C++ code instead of having two search implementations
- Split module.cpp into multiple files
- Only use std::set when needed, and remove any unnecessary < operator overloads
