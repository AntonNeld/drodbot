# DRODbot

This is going to be some kind of automatic player of
[Deadly Rooms of Death](https://drod.caravelgames.com) (DROD).

We'll see how far it gets.

## Running it

> **Note:** I'm trying to use platform-independent dependencies, but I have only tried running it on Linux.

Right now it's just a simple "hello world" program. To try it, install dependencies:

```sh
pipenv install --dev
```

Then run:

```sh
pipenv run python src/drodbot.py
```
